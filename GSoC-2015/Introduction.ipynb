    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This GSoC 2015 Idea will focus on the development of a set of digital notebooks to explore several open source solution for geospatial data analysis, with the aim of bridging together the several software libraries already installed on the live to perform complex *geo-data-science workflows*. \n",
    "\n",
    "The notebooks are developed in the [Jupyter notebook server](https://jupyter.org/) environments which is heavily based on the [IPython](http://ipython.org/) project, are written in different languages (bash, python, R) and are organized in a series of \"topic-oriented\" geospatial notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a complete description of each projects installed on the OSGeo-Live refer to the [OSGeo-Live documentation](http://localhost/osgeolive/en/index.html). This work will focus on the usage of several scientific python libraries like [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/), [scipy](http://www.scipy.org/), [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/), [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) on GFOSS (Geographic Free and Open Source Software) projects like [GRASS](https://grass.osgeo.org/), [GDAL](http://www.gdal.org/), [OSSIM](https://trac.osgeo.org/ossim/), [mapserver](http://mapserver.org/) and more specialized software like [R](https://www.r-project.org/) for geostatistic workflow and [postgis](http://postgis.net/) as geospatial relational database.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The geospatial notebook here developed will make use of the sample dataset installed on the OSGeo-Live:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Natural Earth](http://localhost/osgeolive/en/overview/naturalearth_overview.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "* [OSGeo North Carolina, USA Educational dataset](http://localhost/osgeolive/en/overview/nc_dataset_overview.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "* [OpenStreetMap](http://localhost/osgeolive/en/overview/osm_dataset_overview.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "* [NetCDF Data Set](http://localhost/osgeolive/en/overview/netcdf_dataset_overview.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "The geospatial notebooks here are organized into several topics with the aim of exploring different geospatial libraries installed on the OSGeo-Live. The geospatial notebooks walk the user from simple usage of command line tools such GDAL, PROJ and OSSIM, to basic SQL access of database information, to more complex geoprocessing including data parsing, numerical processing, and finally, the use of a complete GIS platform.\n",
